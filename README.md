# GraphQL Hello World

This repo is an example of how to create your first server using `Apollo Client`, defining your first `GraphQL Type` and a simple `resolver` for a field.
Then you can fetch that data with that data on your `localhost` Apollo Client or fetching it with a simple HTTP request.

## Important things
- All GraphQL Clients do is HTTP Requests.
- You can call a GraphQL server from any language or framework.
- This project is too far away of what real GraphQL projects are.
